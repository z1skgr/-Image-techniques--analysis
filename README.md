### Color Models
1. RGB model.
2. Pictures in Shades of Grey.	
3. HSI model. 
4. White balance. 

### Simple Image Processing Techniques
1. Histogram. 
2. Spatial filters. 
3. Smoothing filters. 
4. Sharpening filters. 

### Fourier Transformation 2D
1. Discrete Fourier transformation. 
2. Fourier transformation presentation as image. 

### Image Restoration
1. Wiener Filter(Least Mean Square Filter). 
2. Constrained Least Squares Restoration. 

## Prerequisites
MATLAB environment (or any software using language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB, see [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index)

## How to run
Run scripts in matlab. Photos have been used in random. They are chosen essential for the purpose of the projects. 

New pictures can be chosen if wanted

## Acknowledgments
Projects were created for the requirements of the lesson Digital Image Processing
